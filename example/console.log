<input> (0): ::containerRayCast - wrong number of arguments.
<input> (0): usage: ( Point3F start, Point3F end, bitset mask, SceneObject exempt=NULL )Cast a ray from start to end, checking for collision against items matching mask.

If exempt is specified, then it is temporarily excluded from collision checks (For instance, you might want to exclude the player if said player was firing a weapon.)
@returns A string containing either null, if nothing was struck, or these fields:
            - The ID of the object that was struck.
            - The x, y, z position that it was struck.
            - The x, y, z of the normal of the face that was struck.
